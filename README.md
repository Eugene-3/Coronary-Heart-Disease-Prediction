The framingham heart study dataset from Kaggle was utilised to compare six machine learning algorithms for the prediction of coronary heart disease.
The six models were built by using 70% of the preprocessed dataset.
30% of the dataset was used to test the models.
Random Forest produced the highest prediction accuracy of 85.25%.
